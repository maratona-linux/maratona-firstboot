# maratona-firstboot

This package will ask user a few questions during first boot.

The idea is to have something like OEM images, i.e, images that are ready
but pending some user specific configurations, in this case we will ask
about:
  * keyboard layout
  * timezone
  * local BOCA IP
  * SITE username and passoword
    - this one is more specific to the ICPC LATAM
